# cogs18project
Project for COGS18 Spring 2021

  The goal of this project is to fetch nutritional information on an item using a barcode scanned by the webcam. The project makes use of the website openfoodfacts.org, and requires a webcam of some sort. When the code is run, the computer's camera will turn on, and a food item can be held up to the camera and scanned. Upon being scanned, a link will open the browser to openfoodfacts.org, where everything from nutritional info to serving size and general information about the product will be displayed.



  The project has several real life applications. Currently, food packaging is required to show nutritional info. A program such as the one I have made would eliminate the need for this (customers could just scan an item with their phone or a barcode reader in a store), which would allow for less packaging and thus less waste. The website also provides ingredient information, which is important to many people but very hard to read, as the font on packaging is very small. Thus, this program would allow users to open up on their phones and read ingredients clearly rather than struggling and potentially misreading.



  As someone interested in nutrition and staying healthy, I find it important to make sure what I put in my body is also beneficial to my health. Nutritional information is something that is available on almost all packaged food, but these labels provide little information into the food and its acutal effects. My project finds the item in a database based on barcode by scanning using a computer's built in camera, and then brings up nutritional information that goes beyond just what's on a label. From an environmental standpoint, barcode scanning can also allow for reduced packaging waste, and easier legibility of ingredients.
